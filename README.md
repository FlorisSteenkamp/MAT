## Introduction

The [MAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_axis) is an analytical form of skeletonization of a shape. It is perfectly suited to SVG. Described by many scholars as *the most important image transform*, it has endless use cases, e.g.:
* **Morphing**
* **Shape thinning and fattening** ⭐⭐ NEW ⭐⭐ [StackBlitz demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-xuruhe?file=index.ts)
* **Shape classification**
* **Shape simplification**
* **Image compression**
* **Shape Triangulation**

The [SAT](http://www.balintmiklos.com/scale-axis/theory_socg_2009.html) is similar to the MAT (and indeed uses it as input) but is often *more practical* as it removes insignifacant MAT branches based on the *local image scale*. The culling severity of branches is controlled by a parameter called *s*.

In the image below, the gray silhouette is the original SVG shape and the blue curves represents the SAT. The SAT (and MAT) is internally represented as a tree data structure with branches being quadratic beziers.

![Alt text](https://raw.github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/MAT/master/github%20assets/two-hole.png)

FloMat is a MAT/SAT library for planar shapes composed of a closed sequence of linear, quadratic and 
cubic bezier curves (such as in SVG). The shape need not be simple, can contain holes and may 
include multiple 'loops'.

For those who are interested, the implementation of the MAT is based on a paper by Hyeong In Choi, Sung Woo Choi, Hwan Pyo Moon and
Nam-Sook Wee that can be freely downloaded 
[here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/70ae/5b583303af0b4d60d356d08f8ed84e1babbc.pdf).
It also gives some valuable insight into the nature of the MAT.

For a less mathematical explanation of the algorithm see 
[this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29921826/how-do-i-calculate-the-medial-axis-for-a-2d-vector-shape).

The implementation of the SAT is similar to the original ideas that can be found in 
[this paper](http://www.balintmiklos.com/scale-axis/scale_axis_transform_socg_2009.pdf)
but it has been improved to preserve topology at any scale >= 1. It also guarantees that
the SAT is a subset of the MAT.

# Code example

Note that the example code given here is in TypeScript since the types make the 
code clearer but plain JavaScript can also be used. 

The live, interactive code can be viewed in this [StackBlitz project](https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript-yucdon).

The code can also be found under 'draw-mat-ts' in the [examples on GitHub](https://github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/mat-examples). Only
the .css and .ts files are reproduced here.

```

The first part of the code is just concerned with importing stuff. Then there is a function
for programatically creating an SVG HTML element. The next three functions, `getLinePathStr`,
`getQuadBezierPathStr` and `getCubicBezierPathStr` will be used for creating the paths that will
represent the Medial Axis on our SVG. Following that is the SVG path string of our shape and
a function, `setSvgShapePath`, to add the path to the SVG.

The next function, `main`, is the entry point of our example. The first two lines creates the
SVG and sets the path. The third line:

```typescript
let bezierLoops = getPathsFromStr(svgPathStr);
```
extracts the path data into an array that is suitable to be comsumed by `findMats`,
the function from the library that will do the number crunching and return an array
of Medial Axis Transforms. The array, `bezierLoops` is of type `number[][][][]`.
It is an array of 'loops'. Each 'loop' (of which there is only one in our case) is a sequence of 
bezier curves such that the starting point of the first bezier corresponds to the end point of 
the last. Each bezier in the loop is represented by its (2, 3 or 4) control points which has type 
signature `number[][]` hence the type `number[][][][]` for `bezierLoops`.
For example, the cubic bezier with control points at (1,1), (5,1), (5,2) and (4,2) is represented as
an array of points `[[1,1],[5,1],[5,2],[4,2]]`. A loop consisting of just 2 beziers can
be encoded as say `[ [[1,1],[5,1],[5,2],[4,2]], [4,2],[3,3],[1,3],[1,1] ]` and finally
we can make an array of loops from this (containing just 1 element) as follows: 
`[[ [[1,1],[5,1],[5,2],[4,2]], [4,2],[3,3],[1,3],[1,1] ]]`. 

The reason for being able to provide an array of loops is because a shape might consist of
an outer loop with one or more inner loops representing holes. This is also reflected
in the fact that SVG paths can have sub-paths. In such a case the inner
loops must have opposite orientation than the outer envelope loop. The rule used to indicate which 
loops form holes and which are part of the shape is the default SVG 
[non-zero](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill-rule)
fill rule. Loops may also intersect each other,
in the process possibly creating more than one disjoint shape. In the above example a single
intersecting loop creates a shape with a hole.

This brings us to the heart of the example, the `findMats` function.

```typescript
let mats = findMats(bezierLoops, 3);
```
The function extracts the Medial Axis Transforms
of all shapes created by the the array of input bezier loops.
It takes an additional parameter indicating the number of points
on each bezier for which a MAT vertex 'point' should be calculated. A
value of 3 is the default and is a reasonable compromise between
speed and accuracy. A value of 15 would give highly accurate
results.

In the special case of a single non-intersecting closed loop
the returned MAT array will be of length 1. Let us look at it 
in more detail.

The returned MAT is essentially a tree data structure. Even if
the shape contains holes it is a tree since
the graph is snipped at so-called hole-closing maximal disks to form a tree. 
(It is still possible though to traverse the MAT as a non-tree graph if required).

As in the example code above, we can traverse the tree to
draw the Medial Axis (MA). This is done by utilizing the `traverseEdges` function. (Note that 
the MA is the MAT but without the maximal disk radius, etc. information encoded on
it). This is accomplished by the `drawMats` function. The inner function, `f`,
draws a single MA. 

First we select a tree node as the root of
the MAT tree. One such node is given to us via `mat.cpNode`.
The tree can now be traversed from this node outwards to the tree
leaves just like in any other tree traversal. Each node, which is
a class of type `CpNode` (for Contact Point Node), has several
properties (see the docs). For our current purposes 
we only need the `matCurveToNextVertex` property.

`matCurveToNextVertex` is a bezier curve (as defined previously with
type `number[][]`) of order 1, 2 or 3 forming a part of 
the MA. In the example code we draw this curve on our orignal SVG.

The `main` function concludes by finding the Scale Axis Transform of our found
MAT and then drawing it on top of the MAT with a different css class (blue).

# Installation

Whether your target is Node or the browser the library can be installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
(For the browser you can also download the [minified.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlorisSteenkamp/MAT/master/browser/index.min.js) file - see below)

So whatever your target, at the the command line:
```cli
npm install flo-mat
```

## Node with JavaScript (or the browser (with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)) or similar) 

In your project
```javascript
let FloMat = require("flo-mat");
```
or if you only want to require specific functionality:
```javascript
let { findMats } = require('flo-mat');
```

## TypeScript

In your project
```typescript
import * as FloMat from "flo-mat";
```
or for specific functionalities:
```typescript
import { findMats } from "flo-mat";
```

## Browser (using global var)

After the npm installation simply include the script in your project:
```html
<script src='node_modules/flo-mat/browser/index.min.js'></script>
```
A new global object will be available called `FloMat` representing the library.
