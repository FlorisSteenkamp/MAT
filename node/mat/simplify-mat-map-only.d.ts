 * Simplifies the given MAT by replacing the piecewise quad beziers composing

 * @param cpNode A representation of the MAT
 * @param anlgeTolerance Tolerance given as the degrees difference of the unit
 * direction vectors at the interface between curves. A tolerance of zero means
 * perfect smoothness is required - defaults to 15.
 * @param hausdorffTolerance The approximate maximum Hausdorff Distance tolerance -
 * defaults to 0.1
 * @param hausdorffSpacing The spacing on the curves used to calculate the Hausdorff
 * Distance - defaults to 1
