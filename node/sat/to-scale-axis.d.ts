 * Apply and returns an enhanced version of the Scale Axis Transform (SAT) to

 *
 * Typically the MAT contains too many branches caused by minute details on the
 * boundary of the shape. The SAT is a simplification of the MAT that preserves
 * less detail the higher the applied scale factor. The severity at which noise
 * are removed depends on the local scale of the shape.
 * @param mat The Medial Axis Transform ([[Mat]]) on which to apply the SAT.
 * @param s The scale factor >= 1 (e.g. 1.3)
